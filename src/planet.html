                        Our porridge product, ‘SUPER OATS’ is designed to tackle two critical challenges: biodiversity loss and food waste. We do this by using a blend of lower-impact, diverse, and upcycled ingredients. After collaborating closely with our UK-based ingredient suppliers, we’ve crafted a delicious, nutritionally balanced porridge made from gluten-free oats, upcycled oats, and UK-grown chia seeds.

                        We’re especially excited about the upcycled ingredient in our porridge, sourced from a UK-based oat miller who has developed a high-protein bran from the insoluble by-products of oat milk production. Previously used for anaerobic digestion or animal feed, they’ve recognized the significant environmental benefits of repurposing this product for human consumption. By toasting the leftover oat pulp, they’ve transformed it into a nutritious and delicious surplus ingredient.

                        With its biscuity aroma and nutritional benefits, we believe that by introducing this ingredient, we can help drive demand for sustainable innovations and make a positive impact on the food system.
